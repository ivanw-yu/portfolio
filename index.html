          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
              I'm a passionate web developer with expertise in developing
              websites using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Redux and Angular.
              In my experiences in web development, I have independently developed 4 websites including a question-and-answers posting application,
              a flashcard application, a photo sharing application and an organization website for the Chinese American Institute of Engineers and Scientists (<a href = "http://iprototypesite.com" target = "_blank">CAIES</a>).

              <br><br>
              I have also developed websites and software in teams for academic projects during my time in San Francisco State University, where I graduated with a
              Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and achieved the Summa Cum Laude honors with a 3.87 GPA.
              I currently work for a community organization, West Bay Pilipino Multi-Service Center, where I mentor elementary, middle and high school youth, plan and facilitate
              academic enrichment and life skills workshops, and tutor students in subjects including Math, English and Computer Science (GitHub and Java).
              <br><br>
              I find joy in building things and it excites me to see websites grow from initial mock ups to finalized products.
              The consistent excitement I have for software development has motivated me to continually educate myself and take on big challenges
              in order to polish my skills and effective habits as a web developer.
              <br><br>
              My skills and experiences has allowed me to grow comfortable in developing websites by myself and in team environments.
              I'm currently looking for an entry-level software engineer role for a company where I can grow professionally and use my skills to contribute to team success.




              <!-- CONINUE: Say something about liking working alone and with team
                            - like im comfortable working alone or with team
                            - I like team settings too and the work dynamics
            -->

              <!-- I also have experiences working in teams to develop websites and software for academic projects.


              My passion for coding and web development continues to drive me to better my skills as a developer as I continue to deepen and expand my
              technical skills by reading documentations and watching videos. -->
